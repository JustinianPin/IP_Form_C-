# IP_Form_C-
This is an small application in C# where you can solve a polynomial or trigonometric function just passing the parameters. It is very easy to use and intuitive.
The Application's code is in the Directory "lab2_IP". It is named so because I implemented the application as a homework of Software Engineering laboratory (IP = Ingineria Programarii).
